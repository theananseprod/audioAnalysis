Thesis :  
Use of AI to moniter/check samplings { within music , poetry , and sonic media } .  

Benefit :  
To increase the monetization of art and creation of music that artists , especially those historically disenfranchised ( i.e. Black/African-Americans in relation to the creation and innovation of Rock , R&B , Folk , Funk , Jazz , Gospel , Bluegrass , Country , Disco , Soul , Neo-Soul , Hip-Hop , etc . ; and Caribbeans in relation to the creation and innovation of Calypso , Reggae , Soca , etc . ; and Africans in relation to the creation and innovation of Amapiano , AfroFusion , etc .  )  

Synopsis :  
Based on wavelength , an original musical composition ( i.e. the signature wavelength of the sonics of the original audio creation ) should be able to be distinguishable within a sample ( including : remixes , loops , chops , etc. ) that is in storage of the database – or as input – therefore increasing the ability of musicians ( esp . artists ) to know of their ongoing contributions to the generation and enjoyment of music , as well as introduce more opportunity to receive compensation per copyright & material .
